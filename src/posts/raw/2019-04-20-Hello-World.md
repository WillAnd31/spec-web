# :wave: Hello World!

<=desc=>When I'm trying to solve a hard problem I usually have like 50 tabs open with the specs of whatever technology I'm working with. That's why I'm calling this respository of my thoughts, The Spec.<=desc=>

I think blogs are stupid. Nobody wants to read the thoughts of some rando in longform, boring. That's why this isn't a blog! I have a lot of thoughts, I play around with a lot of technology, I get obsessed with subjects and learn everything there is know about things. I need a place to share my thoughts and the things I've learned, so I did a little `mkdir` and here we are.

This post is essentially meaningless, but I thought I would introduce myself incase anyone actually cares to read what I have to say. I intend to use this platform to share solutions to technical problems I run into, and maybe some side projects I might be playing around with. But if you care to learn a little about myself and the context in which I intend to use this platform in, please read ahead :grin:

## Passion

I have a deep passion for technology. To some people developing software is a job, for me it's a hobby. I'm extraordinarily lucky to be able to make money off something I love. Also, I'm pretty good at it.

Software engineering is so fun for me because I love puzzles. I have a modest collection of Rubik's cubes and twisty puzzles because they are just so satisfying to solve. To me, all software is just a bunch of complicated puzzles and solving those puzzles is so much fun.

## Agenda

I have an agenda. The passion I've developed for technology has grown from more than just interest in the underlying soft and hard wares. With technology __we__ can do so much more. With technology we can eliminate poverty, enhance and protect democracy, overthow oppressors, cure diseases, discover unknown truths, and so much more. Obviously technology has the capability of doing the exact opposite too which is why I feel like I need to do something to maybe help steer this ever evolving technological world in the right direction.

I beleive that the large tech companies that control the industry have lead __us__ down a scary path. We should be talking about the rights that our users have to their data, that is a conversation we simply haven't had nationally yet. Why? Because Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple do not want to give up their access to __our__ data. These companies have paid off politicians to look the other way while they "self regulate", and their idea of self regulation is just disclosure and not punishment. All carrot, no stick. There are conversations we must have as a democratic society, but these large tech companies have shut down and have ignored many important conversations. It's unhealthy for our society, and it has been detrimental to the tech industry as a whole.

My agenda is to talk about these issues I see in the tech industry and the problems that have spilt over into other parts of our society. I'm no authority on any of these issues. I'm just some random person on the internet, but I hardly see anyone else talking about the issue I'm concerned about so if not me, who?

I'm an engineer, I like to fix problems, not talk about them. Maybe I've been in way too many product meetings, but when there's a complicated project I like to just jump in. It's like writing a draft, I get an idea of the different types of approaches that can be taken to solve the problem or finish the project. That's what the Spec is, it's a draft spec of my ideas and my approaches to problems and projects.

The agenda is to start the conversation and provide a draft solution to the problems I present. Maybe something I share will push forward my agenda of providing ethical and well developed technology that helps the lives of my users, more likely it will be a fun side project for me to play around with. Either way, that is the agenda.

## :rose: We - Us :rose:

It is my beleif that technology is better when it is open sourced and is freely available to use and develop with. We all exist in the same technological ecosystem and that ecosystem wouldn't be able to function and be as innovative if it weren't for open source technology. The languages we develop software with are all pretty much open source and the practice of giving back to the software community is strong in many parts of the tech industry. The notion that something you made becoming free to use for anyone is extraordinary, what other industry has that type of communal relationship? I beleive that this idea can be applied in areas outside of the tech industry.

Software engineers learned long ago that there are common problems that can easily be solved and that it's easier and more efficient to just provide those solutions for free so others could benefit as well. It is evident to me that society has many of those same type of problems that can be "open sourced". When we as engineers contribute to open source software we are benefitting everyone that consumes that software, not just yourself or the company you work for. Similarly when we as citizens contribute to the communities around us we are benefitting everyone in that community and not just yourself.

Software has the potential to put many people out of jobs. Automation will destroy people's livelyhoods and that is just a fact. That is why I beleive we as a society must ensure that every single person in our community is taken care of. I am especially aware of this as a software engineer because I know that the software I create has the potential to make it so that some parent will not be able to afford to send their child to college. I am aware that I could be the reason someone dies because they didn't have health insurance because they got laid off as a result of an optimization I did on some indexes in a database that lead to a 30% reduction of support calls. I realize that the specific technical knowledge I have will become obselete in 3 years and if I don't keep up with the technology I might have my own job automated away.

It is imperative that we realize that we are a small part of a larger community and it is imcumbent on us to ensure that those in our community are taken care of. When someone is oppressed or discriminated against that hurts everyone, not just those who were victimized. Diversity is important for that reason. If we don't know about the problems in communities that we aren't part of then we can't help that community and in return the larger community still is harmed. As an engineer it is important for me to have all the data possible, if my community isn't diverse enough I may be blind to data that could impact the analysis I do on the data I have. The tech industry has notoriously had problems with diversity because software has the potential to be consumed by millions and even billions of users, so if the software didn't take into account the diversity of its consumers then it can lead to horrible results.

I'm highlighting these ideas in my first post because I think they are trumendusly important. I am extremely privledged to be able to have the career, and life, that I have and I hope I can use my ill-deserved privledge to promote a more equitable and just society.
